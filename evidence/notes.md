### Q1: Last time using task manager?

### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**: Apps not designed with accessibility in mind. Small text or poor contrast causes difficulty. Once tried to add shopping reminder and couldn't see default categories because text was too faint. Worked around by using voice assistant to navigate, or uses device in built contrast settings. Failing all this, reverted to using sticky notes. Was also frustrated by poor syncing of tasks across devices - uses phone at home and laptop at work and is prone to losing tasks if glitches occur.

**Observations**: Contrast helps with usability. Voice assistance/narration can act as a backup. Likely won't use an app if accessibility needs not well met.

### Q3: Lost track of an important task?
**Response**: Yes - work deadline. Didn't save properly or didn't sync to phone. Manager asked about it on the day it was due and Participant A had to work overtime to finish it. Learned to double-check tasks saved and synced and appreciates features like notifications and recurring reminders more. Losing track of the task made Participant A feel overwhelmed and embarrassed, and less confident in relying on to-do apps moving forward. 

**Observations**:  Participant A uses the task managers for high stakes tasks like work tasks, and thus requires high reliability.  This necessitates not only differentiation of high and low priority tasks, but differentiation of how they are handled.

### Q4: Working without a mouse?
**Response**: Sometimes, when on a train for example. In these cases, rely on keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures. Working without a mouse makes clear and well organised interfaces more important. They also make accessibility features like voice control more useful.

**Observations**: Lack of a mouse hinders navigation, making poor interface layout even more aggravating. Highlights the importance of alternate interface options.

### Q5: Used a task manager with eyes closed/in bright sunlight?

**Response**: Yes, when relying on voice commands, and in bright sunlight where screen glare makes reading difficult. With eyes closed, its hard to know if something has been saved properly if the app does not confirm actions clearly. Bright sunlight exacerbates poor colour contrast and small text.

**Observations**: When vision is reduced, confirmation feedback of actions performed by the user becomes more difficult.

**Themes**: `[accessibility]`, `[action-feedback]`

### Q6: One feature to make task management less stressful?
**Response**: A robust voice assistant that can perform everything Participant A would usually use the task management app for. 

**Observations**: For a user that uses alternative input methods, it is important that they can perform tasks equally well as someone using a keyboard and mouse.

**Themes**: `[accessibility]`

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. When using a screen reader/voice assistant, apps often don't convey confirmation of actions effectively. [Q5, Q3, Q6]
2. Poor design choices like bad colour contrast cause difficulty in using the app. [Q5, Q1, Q2]
